                <p class="para">You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. We have a saboteur aboard. Ensign Babyface! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Not if I weaken first. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Well, that's certainly good to know. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant?</p>

                <p class="para">Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.  Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
